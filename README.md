## Overview
This repository contains experiments and projects carried out in the **Digital IC Design Lab**. The focus of this lab is to design, implement, and simulate digital circuits using **Cadence EDA Tools**. The experiments cover both combinational and sequential circuits, CMOS inverter characteristics, and advanced CMOS designs. Simulations are conducted using **CMOS 180 nm** and **65 nm processes**, with performance metrics such as **static/dynamic power dissipation**, **delay**, **noise margin**, and the impact of **PVT (Process-Voltage-Temperature) variations** analyzed in detail.
